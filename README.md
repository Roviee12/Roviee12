                <h3>MY FAMILY</h3>
                <p> 
                    This is my family, who taught me how to be strong in everyday life despite all the problems that we encountered. 
                    Actually, my mom and dad have been separated from each other since I'm in the fourth grade in elementary school. 
                    Even though I came from a broken family, I'm still blessed because they still love me and they still have good communication with each other. 
                    The little girl in the picture, Verna, is my half-sister with my mom; she's the most wonderful gift from above, and I still love her because I love her very much. 
                    I'm still hoping that our family can go back to living in one home.</p> <!-- Description of the project -->
